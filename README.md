# BMI Calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration. Use the "Metric Units" tab for the International System of Units or the "Other Units" tab to convert units into either US or metric units. Note that the calculator also computes the Ponderal Index in addition to BMI, both of which are discussed below in detail.

## How does it work?

- **User Inputs Data**: The user enters their height (in cm) and weight (in kg) into the provided input.
- **BMI Calculation**: When the user clicks the "Calculate" button, JavaScript will retrieve the input values, calculate the BMI using the BMI formula (weight / (height/100)^2), and store the result in a variable.
- **Displaying Results**: The BMI calculation result is then displayed on the web page, along with the corresponding weight category based on the obtained BMI value.
